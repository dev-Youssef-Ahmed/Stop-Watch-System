The Stop Watch System is the mini-project #2 of Standard Embedded Systems Diploma at Edges for Training Academy, under the expert guidance of Mohamed Tarek.

This project involves developing a system that control the stop-watch time and display it on 7-segments. It utilizes various drivers including GPIO, Timer, External Interrupts and 7-Segement for functionality.

> MCAL: GPIO, INT0, INT1, and INT2.

> HAL: SEVEN_SEGMENTS, its DECODER, and BUTTONS.

The project uses buttons to generate ISRs to Pasuse, Resume, or Reset the stop watch.

Here is some screenshots from the system:
